# Snow

This is a Top-Down shooter, Team-Based game, my first game actually.

Made for the <a href =https://itch.io/jam/linux-game-jam-2022>"Linux Game Jam 2022"</a>, with <a href = https://www.raylib.com/index.html>Raylib</a> and C, the art was done in Aseprite.

Open source GPLv3. I got rid of most of the crucial bugs, but the code is very spaghetti at this point. 

This game's player and bots are penguins because of the Linux logo , and it's design is inspired by a little game i played as a kid, SnowCraft.

you can play on <a href = https://cosmicnomad.itch.io/snow>itch.io.</a>
