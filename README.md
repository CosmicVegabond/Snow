# Snow
	This is a Top-Down shooter, Team-Based game, my first game actually.
	It was made for the "Linux Game Jam 2022", with Raylib and C, the art was done in Aseprite.
	Open source GPLv3. I got rid of most of the crutial bugs, but the code is very spaghetti at this point. 
	This game's player and bots are penguins because of the linux logo , and it's design is ispired by a little game i played as a kid, SnowCraft.
	you can play on itch on: https://cosmicnomad.itch.io/snow
